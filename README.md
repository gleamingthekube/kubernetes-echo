# Kubernetes Echo deployment/service
A simple Kubernetes deployment and service forked from https://github.com/SIMPLrU/interactive/blob/master/konglabs/kong-ingress-controller/manifests/echo-service.yml

This creates 2 replicas of the gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images/echoserver:2.2 image and exposes it over a clsuterIP.
